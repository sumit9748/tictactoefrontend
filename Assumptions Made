I made several assumptions like
1. when the game ends i think it is better to show only the results instead of showing the board.
2. some login and logout buttons to move here and there.
3. I also try to make the logic more faster by adding some extra parameters into my board schema like fill and status.
4. if some user is logged in he/she must have shown main menu
5. after registering user should landed onto login page
